# Bayes' Theorem Medical Diagnosis Calculator

This is a Python application that calculates the probability of having a disease based on test results using Bayes' Theorem. It is useful in medical diagnostics to interpret test outcomes more accurately.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Inputs: 
  - Prevalence of disease (P(Disease))
  - Test Sensitivity (P(Test+ | Disease))
  - Test Specificity (P(Test- | No Disease))
- Outputs:
  - Probability of disease given a positive test
  - Probability of disease given a negative test

## ðŸ§ª Example

For:
- Prevalence = 0.1
- Sensitivity = 0.9
- Specificity = 0.95

Output:
